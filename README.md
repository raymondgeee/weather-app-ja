# Weather APP & Travel Information
## Overview

For the front-end i use Vue JS, seems this is a good to use for SPA(single-page applications). The documentation is also easy to understand and more resources from the internet, i use also sass for the design of the project as well as the grid system in css. I use Laravel Framework for the backend since its easy to use and also the documentations is good and understanable, it has a pre-built functions to use to lessen the time of the project creation. It has MVC structure that can easily organize the files.
